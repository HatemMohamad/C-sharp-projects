# C-sharp-projects

This repository contains the projects, exercises, and code samples I created while learning **C#** and the **.NET framework**. Each assignment helped me build a solid understanding of C# fundamentals, object-oriented programming, and real application development.

## 🚀 What I Learned

- Core C# fundamentals (classes, methods, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism)
- Operator overloading and method parameter usage
- Building structured, reusable, object-oriented code
- Implementing and using interfaces such as `IQuittable`
- Creating ASP.NET MVC applications
- Working with controllers, views, and models
- Using Entity Framework to communicate with SQL Server
- Full-stack concepts like form handling, validation, and CRUD operations

## 📁 What's Inside

- Console application exercises  
- Object-oriented programming drills  
- Operator overloading examples  
- ASP.NET MVC “Car Insurance Quote” project  
- Database-connected applications using Entity Framework  

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo serves as both a learning archive and a reference for future C# development. It reflects my journey through the course and my growing confidence with the C# language and .NET platform.

## 🧑‍💻 Future Plans

I plan to continue building projects in C#, exploring areas like:
- Desktop apps  
- Web APIs  
- Cloud-ready .NET applications  
- Unity game development
